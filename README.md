# Brock_Mirman
Jupyter notebook for using Dynare-Julia and Projection Methods for the Brock-Mirman Model
This contains a Dynare .mod file, a Jupyter notebook and a startup.jl file with the credentials to use Dynare-Julia.
Please only use Julia version 1.9.4.   Later versions, now at 1.10.2, seem to have problems.
Once Julia and Anaconda are installed with the Jupyter notebook, you will find a .julia folder after Users/(name).
In the .julia folder creat a "config" subfolder and paste in the startup.jl file.
When you start running the notebook for the first time, you will have to add various packages which will make some time.
For later use you will not need to add the packages.
